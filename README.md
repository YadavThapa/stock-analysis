# stock-analysis
My VBA macro

# Overview of Project
Steve recently got finance degree from University and wants to help his parent by understanding and analyzing the total tickers stocks sold out for the year 2018. 
He wants to develop the VBA macro which can automate the Microsoft excel worksheet or routined tasks and it saves the significant amount of time over a long run.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to help Steve by creating VBA macro which reduces the significant amount time to understand and analyze the stock volumes sold out yearly basis.

## Results
From our study we came to conclusion that the refactoring the code may reduce significant amount of time instead writing original code.

## Summary 

Refactoring is the process of restructuring the existing code inside the application without changing external behaviour. The main motive of refacoring is to improve design, 
structure and implementaion of application.

Code Refactoring is an important exercise to remove bad code. It helps to find bugs, makes programs run faster, it's easier to understand the code, improves the design of software application , etc. Bad Code slows down the development and is prone to more defects. An adequate set of unit tests and a supportive environment should be there for
code refactoring.

## Advantages of refactored code 
The main advantages of refactored code are as follows.

#### Maintainability
It is easier to fix the bugs because code is easy to read. The main advantage is easy to grasp. This might be achieved by reduced large chuck of code in to small routined
set of individual concise, well-name, single purpose method or appropiate class or by removing misleading comments.

### Extensibility
It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns, and it provides some flexibility. It helps to enhance the existing code.

## Disadvantage of refactored code

Refactoring activities generate architectural modifications that deteriorate the structural architecture of a software system. Such deterioration affects architectural properties such as maintainability and comprehensibility which can lead to a complete re-development of software systems

### Risky
Changing the code might be more risky if there is no proper structre and it is more prone to misleading result.

### Expensive
After refactoring the code, the application should be tested throughly to ensure there is not other adverse effect after implimentation. It may be more resource and 
time consuming process.

## advantages original script code
The original code explains each line of code and its objective in very detailed, structured and designed way. 

Follwings are the advantage of original script code agains the refactored code.
### Concise
The objective behind writing each individual line of code is crystal clear, structured and it helps other reader to understand the code in a very less time.

## Disadvantages of original code
Writing original code may take longer time and we should not starting writing if the deliverable has time bound.

Code refactoring may help software developers discover and fix hidden or dormant bugs or vulnerabilities in the system by simplifying the underlying logic and eliminating unnecessary levels of complexity. If done poorly, it may fail the requirement that external functionality not be changed, introduce new bugs, or both.
