## Results

## Summary 

## Advantage of refactored code
Refactoring is the process of restructuring the existing code inside the application without changing external behaviour. The main motive of refacoring is to improve design, 
structure and implementaion of application.

set of individual concise, well-name, single purpose method or appropiate class or by removing misleading comments.

### Extensibility
It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns, and it provides some flexibility.

## Disadvantage of refactored code

### Risky
Changing the code might be more risky if there is no proper structre and it is more prone to misleading result.
